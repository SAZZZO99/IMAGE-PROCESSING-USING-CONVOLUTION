<h3> KRISH OPERATOR </h3>
The Kirsch operator or Kirsch compass kernel is a non-linear edge detector that finds the maximum edge strength in a few predetermined directions.
The operator takes a single kernel mask and rotates it in 45 degree increments through all 8 compass directions: N, NW, W, SW, S, SE, E, and NE.

<h3> ROBINSON OPERATOR </h3>
Robinson compass masks are another type of derrivate mask which is used for edge detection. This operator is also known as direction mask. In this operator we take one mask and rotate it in all the 8 compass major directions.
